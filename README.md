Introduction
--------------
This lab is designed to create a VGA interface between our FPGA board through the HDMI out into a VGA monitor. For this lab, we used finite state machines to manipulate and send signals. These signals sync up with the monitor and allow us to transmit images to a display. 

Our problem was to inteface to a monitor over an HDMI to DVI cable using a VGA machine and some adaption code to change from VGA to HDMI. We had to come up with the H_SYNC, V_SYNC, VGA_SYNC, and PIXEL_GEN signals. Code was given to us in the top level but we had to interface all our components.
